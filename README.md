# Face-Detection
Project Overview:-
This project involves the development of a real-time face detection model using a Haar-like Cascade Classifier. The model integrates computer vision techniques for video capture and image preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation. The primary objective is to detect human faces in real-time and draw rectangles around them.

Key Features:-

• Real-Time Detection: Utilizes a Haar-like Cascade Classifier for efficient face detection.

• Computer Vision Integration: Captures video frames using a laptop camera and preprocesses images for enhanced detection accuracy.

• Image Preprocessing: Applies techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.

• Manual Annotation: Faces in captured photos are manually annotated to create a labeled training dataset.

• Model Training: The model is trained on the annotated data to enhance its face detection capabilities.
